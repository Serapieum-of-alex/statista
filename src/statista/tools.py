class Tools:
    """Collection of statistical and data transformation utilities.

    This class provides static methods for various data transformations and
    manipulations commonly used in statistical analysis, including normalization,
    standardization, rescaling, and logarithmic transformations.

    All methods are implemented as static methods, so they can be called directly
    without instantiating the class.

    Examples:
        - Import the Tools class:
            ```python
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from statista.tools import Tools

            ```
        -  Normalize an array to [0, 1] range
            ```python
            >>> data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
            >>> normalized = Tools.normalize(data)
            >>> print(normalized)
            [0.   0.25 0.5  0.75 1.  ]

            ```
        - Standardize an array (mean=0, std=1):
            ```python
            >>> standardized = Tools.standardize(data)
            >>> print(f"Mean: {np.mean(standardized):.4f}, Std: {np.std(standardized):.4f}")
            Mean: 0.0000, Std: 1.0000

            - Then inv_log_rescale back from [0, 3] to [1, 1000]:
