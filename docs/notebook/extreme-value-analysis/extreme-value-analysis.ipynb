    "Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) is a branch of statistics that deals with the extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions.

    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the `statista` package to perform extreme value analysis on time series data. We'll explore two common distributions used in EVA:\n",
