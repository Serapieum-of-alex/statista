"""Extreme value analysis.

Annual Maximum Series (AMS) Analysis is a statistical method commonly used in fields like hydrology, meteorology, and
environmental engineering to analyze extreme events, such as floods, rainfall, or temperatures. The primary goal of AMS
analysis is to assess the frequency and magnitude of extreme events over time.

Key Concepts of AMS Analysis

Definition:
    The Annual Maximum Series is a time series composed of the maximum values observed within each year. For example,
    in hydrology, the AMS might consist of the highest daily flow recorded in each year for a river.

Purpose:
    The AMS is used to model and predict the probability of extreme events occurring in the future. This is crucial for
    risk assessment and the design of infrastructure to withstand such events (e.g., dams, levees, drainage systems).

Advantages of AMS Analysis
    - Simplicity: AMS analysis is straightforward and focuses on extreme events, which are often of primary interest.
    - Historical Context: Provides insights based on historical extreme values, which are directly relevant for
        planning and design.

Limitations of AMS Analysis
    - Data Limitations: The accuracy of AMS analysis depends on the availability and quality of long-term data.
    - Ignores Sub-Annual Events: AMS considers only one value per year, potentially ignoring significant events that
        occur more than once in a year.

Common Applications:
    - Flood Frequency Analysis: AMS is often used to estimate the probability of extreme flood events to help design
        flood control infrastructure.
    - Rainfall Analysis: Used to assess the risk of extreme rainfall events for urban drainage design.
    - Temperature Extremes: AMS can be used to evaluate the risk of extremely high or low temperatures.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time_series_df: DataFrame
        DataFrame containing multiple time series to do the statistical analysis on.
    ams: bool
        True if the given time series is annual mean series. Default is False.

        True if you want to save the plots.
    save_to: str
        The rdir where you want to save the statistical properties.
    filter_out: bool
        For observed or hydraulic model data it has gaps of times where the model did not run or gaps in the observed
        data if these gap days are filled with a specific value and you want to ignore it here
        give filter_out = Value you want
    distribution: str, Default is "GEV".
        distribution name.
    method: str, Default is "lmoments".
        available methods are 'mle', 'mm', 'lmoments', 'optimization'.

    - The time series data we have just read are the annual maximum series of the gauges, the first column is an
        index of the year (54 years in total) and the rest are dischate values in m3/s for each the station. a value 0f
        "-9" is used to fill the missing data.
    - The `ams_analysis` function takes the time series `DataFrame` as the first and only positional argument,
        all the other arguments are optional. Since the time series is annual maximum series already, so we don't
        need the function to do any resampling, we set `ams=True`. The `ams_start` could be used to provide the
        beginning of the year to resample the time series to ams (i.e., `ams_start = "A-OCT"`).
    - We want to save the plots, so we set `save_plots=True` and provide the directory where we want to save the plots in
        `save_to`.
    - We also want to filter out the missing data, so we set `filter_out=-9`.
    - In order to fit the time series to a distribution we also to provide the parameter estimation method (i.e.,
        `lmoments`, `mle`, `mm`, `optimization`), the default is the `lmoments`, and you need to provide the name of
        the distribution you want to fit the time series to (i.e., `GEV`, `Gumbel`). So for that we
        will use `method="lmoments"`, and `distribution="GEV"`.
    - The `alpha` is the significance level of the confidence interval, the default is 0.1. The `alpha` parameter is
        necessary for the confidence interval calculation.
